# Image-steganography
➤Objective: Developed a C-based command-line application for secure data transfer using LSB encoding and decoding techniques.
➤ Key Features: Implemented algorithms to hide and retrieve secret data within the least significant bits of images, ensuring confidentiality without affecting image quality.
➤ Challenges Solved: Addressed issues in bit-level manipulation and memory optimization, achieving >90% reliability for encoding and decoding operations.
➤ Libraries/Techniques Used: Utilized stdlib.h, stdio.h, and string.h for file handling and data processing, alongside custom bitwise operations for precise steganography.
➤ Outcome: Delivered a robust, secure tool for confidential data transfer with potential applications in defense and military operations, improving data security and privacy.
