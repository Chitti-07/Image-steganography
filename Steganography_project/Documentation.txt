Project: Image Steganography

->Overview:

    This project is about hiding secret messages inside pictures using a method called steganography,
    The goal is to embed/write a secret message into an image in such a way that the image looks unchanged,
    Later, we can extract the hidden message from the image.

->There are two main functions in this project:
    Encoding: Hiding a message inside an image
    Decoding: Extracting the hidden message from the image

->Pixel:
    A picture is made up of tiny dots called pixels
    We change the smallest part of these pixels (called the "Least Significant Bit") to hide the message. 
    Even though we make small changes to the pixels, the image still looks the same.

->Encoding Process:
    We take a BMP image and the secret message or file you want to hide,
    The secret message is hidden inside the imageâ€™s pixels,
    A new image is created with the secret message hidden inside.

->Decoding Process:
    We take the image with the hidden message (stego-image),
    The hidden message is extracted from the pixels of the image
    The message is written to a file.

->command line arguments for encoding
    ./a.out -e beautiful.bmp secret_file.txt output_file(optional)

->Command line arguments for decoding
    ./a.out -d stego.bmp output_file(optional)

Run the encoding process to hide the message.
Run the decoding process to extract the message.
